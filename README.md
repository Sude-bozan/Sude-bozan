# Hi! I'm Sude.

I'm a **Junior Data Analyst** working on datasets using SQL, Python, Power BI, and Microsoft Excel.
In 2023, I attended the **Data Analyst course** offered by **Kodlasam** and successfully completed my education by working on projects using **Microsoft Excel, PostgreSQL, Python,** and **Power BI**. 

We worked with various datasets such as **Northwind Traders, Hotel Booking,** and **Nobel Prize**. Using these datasets, we practiced making queries on topics including **data manipulation, data visualization,** and **data understanding**.
